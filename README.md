INTRODUCTION

Background of the Study
The Voting App was designed to mitigate errors and be efficient, versatile, learnable, memorable, effective, and usable for all voters across a variety of device types. Errors were mitigated by notifying users of errors immediately after they were committed. Efficiency was achieved by minimizing the number of button presses required to complete a task. Versatility was achieved by testing and ensuring that the Voting App did indeed function on a variety of devices. Learnability and memorability were achieved by creating a minimalistic interface with few commands, a consistent layout, and legible displays. Effectiveness and user satisfaction of various design considerations were evaluated in the empirical studies.(Washington, DC 2005)
On the Cabulohan-Paradise National High School, the researchers noticed that the SSG election is done manually, and the voting can take a lot of time. It used a lot of time to tally the votes and needs more officers to conduct the election. Sometimes the votes of the students where misplaced and miscount by the Comelec. An automated election system gives you a head start collecting and analyzing data automatically. All you have to do is review and make a decision based on the analysis. The accuracy level is very high because the chance of human error is minimized, and it significantly saves time and cost (GrowHawk, 2020).

This study is focused on implementing a web-based election system for the students and committee of Cabulohan-Paradise National High School to provide automatic generation of votes which the students gives.

Statement of the problem 
In the Cabulohan-Paradise National High School voting system, one of the primary respondents in the students, and the data accumulate, is from their experience using manual. It means practically useful, but having manual voting has a lot of disadvantages; time-consuming, prone to error, misplaced, and hard to make changes. In today’s hard time, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide at lightning speed, killing hundreds of thousands of people and infecting millions. It can spread primarily from person to person and close contact with someone sick, like hugging and shaking hands. Students are vulnerable when they give election manually as one of the health protocols is to maintain social distancing, especially in a school or public area. During these crisis times, the voting is more significant as the majority of the states stay at home for safety. This system fucoses on students which will be placed in a school or organization for better giving a good servicing process to maintain the quality of students. 
Furthermore, the current method necessitates the manual entry or collected data into a database is further study. This method is vulnerable to human errors, which efforts data quality, to provide helpful knowledge for informed discussion-making, the administration needs to refocus its efforts from data collection to research. With the emergence of the internet, data collection can be facilitated by an automated election system.


	


Conceptual Framework 
The automotive election system is a web-based application that manages voters by putting voting’s data ratings regarding elections, voting and evaluation. With the use of the voting system web-based application can automate the collection of data in a particular way of modeling processes through website that more or less unconsciously used. 


Figure B Visualization of the Conceptual Framework
The students and teachers must select what officer they register, there are thirteen (13) kind of officers; President, V-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Auditor, P.I.O, Protocol Officer, G12-Representative, G11-Representative, G10-Representative, G9-Representative, G8-Representative, and G7-Representative. Then after inputting the chosen officers, it should submit their selected officers to the voting system. Figure B above shows the flow operation of the system.






































1.4 Objectives of the Study 

The main objective of this study is to develop an automated voting system of Cabulohan-Paradise National High School to quickly facilitate the election.

The specific objectives 
To design a voting system that will collect all data and ranking of voters.
To test the system’s functionality and usability and deploy the voting system using free, open-source software.
To develop an algorithm or method to resolving manual election.
















 Significant of the study
This study is significant to the voters provide an online satisfaction survey and spontaneous voters voting procedure in Cabulohan-Paradise National High School; thus, it also beneficial the following; Students, Teachers, Parents, Staff, and visitors to utilize the system inconvenience for their safety, it will help them to continue voting’s despite the many restriction and other confinement measures.
Voters are the primarily users of the system that will help them to votes virtually. In response to this pandemic, voters can perform their responsibility to gives their votes. Voters can provide their Personal Information to the system cause their Personal Information cannot be exploited, after all, the system is genuinely owned by the Administrator.
The benefits that the Comelec or Administrator of the election will get from the system are easy to access and conveniently give the ranking of the election because it’s a web-based system, especially in today’s time where we are experiencing pandemic and maintaining standard health protocols. 
Administrator Staff, this system would reduce the strenuous work of physically doing the manual form to the voters and reduce physical contact to avoid the transmission of the virus.
This study will help the Information Communication Technology students to expand their knowledge in making a web-based application. Through this Information Communication students will enhance their skills in making this kind of system. Future researcher. This system may provide new insight and new knowledge that will help or benefit future Information Communication Technology researchers. As much, this system can also be open for further development and improvement.


Scope and Limitations
This study will mainly identify and assess different system application process to present what voters and Administrator need. Also, this study yearns to determine how researcher can develop the system in the field of web-based application.
	The function that is included in this system is you can input and where the users can do the following; Dashboard Features- this feature will allow the Administrator to know the ranking of election. Purpose of Votes Feature- this means to know how much who votes to the election. Voters Feature- this means that the voters must registered their Personal Information to get a voter’s ID and Password that require during election. Purpose of Position Features it means that the administrator must put the position of any one thing must register their Personal Information, Running Position, and Platform of their party list. Ballot Position Features it means that the Ballot Position is the only thing that voters can see. Election Title Features- this is the most extraordinary feature because this voting system can do anything in connection of election not only for SSG election it’s flexible for any types of election. Sign in Features- it means that the voters must sign in their voter’s ID and Password. Once the voters already done voting they cannot vote again. CSS Features mean all the clients from different offices can comment, complain, and suggest the services they encountered per department. The report and Take action feature will allow the customer to report any concerns and complaints about the election. Also, once it's reported, the person in charge per office will take the actions feature to solve the reports. Data manipulation- this allows the admin to add, edit, delete and update the data. This system is suitable for SSG Automated Election system. The webpage allows to access offline because this system we applied Localhost Application.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
This chapter provides a review of the literature. The following literature immensely contributed to the conceptualization of this study is making a system and are presented in the following topics:
2.1 Related Studies
	2.1.1 Difference between Automatic Voting System and Manual Process
	It’s challenging to scale up manual labor. With a manual process, as you scale, you must invest more in human resources. This isn’t the case with a web-based automated voting system. When you upscale the software, it works perfectly and requires no additional input. The method is the same whether you’re collecting votes from 500 or 5,000 people. When employing and automated voting system, transparency and accountability are also improve. When we work by hand, it’s not always easy to change votes tally and information with COMELEC. However with a web-based system, all data, profile and ranks are saved in the software and easily accessible by the Administrator and COMELEC (Hawlk, 2020).  
	2.1.2 The Benefits of Web-Based Systems
	 According to (AEZION, 2020) web based applications used to be very limited in functionality. However, advances in technology, security, and internet speeds have greatly increased the potential scope of web-based system. Today, we have web-based Election voting system, web-based CRM systems, a web-based Microsoft Office, and more. Web-based Applications offer some significant advantages over native, client-based software.   
 	

2.1.3 Similarities Between Offline and Online Voting System 
Online Voting is a web-based voting system that will help you manage your elections easily and securely. This voting system can be used for casting votes during elections held in high school, etc. In this system the voter do not have to go the pooling booth to cast their vote. They can use their personal computer to cast their votes. There is a database which is maintained in which all the name of the voters with their complete information is stored. The System Administrator registers the voters by simply filling a registration form to register the voters. After registration, the voter is assigned a secret voter ID with which he/she can use to login to the system and cast his/her votes. If invalid/wrong details are submitted, then the person is not register to vote. After the user successfully registers themselves, a link is sent on their respective E-mail IDs. The link is a key for the activation of the account of the user. The account is activated only after the user clicks on the link. The site will be activated only on the day of voting. Once the user logs in, they will be provided with a One Time Password (OTP) which has to be entered by the user before casting his/her vote. The password will be destroyed after casting of their respective vote. A receipt of the vote will be sent to the user on their respective E-mail IDs. The advantage of online voting is that the voters have the choice of voting at their own free time and there is reduced congestion. It also minimizes on errors of vote counting. The individual votes are submitted in a data-base which can be queried to find out who of the aspirants for a given post has the highest number of votes (Mihir, 2020).

PROJECT DETAILS/METHODOLOGY









Figure 3 Agile Methodology

This chapter will determine the materials used and methods that will be done to achieve the goals of this study. We choose the Agile Methodology. The Agile approach combines both incremental and iterative methodologies. It is iterative because it intends for one iteration's work to be improved upon in subsequent iterations.

3.1 System Requirements
The proposed system will provide an efficient function with regards to giving Election through the following requirements:
3.1.1 Software
To make and convey this system, it begins with the front-end, which is bootstrapped. In addition, Javascript allows you to make web pages interactive, CSS is used for styling and laying out webpages, AJAX is a set web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous we application, HTML is used to structure a web page and its content, Xampp helps a local host or server to test its website and clients via computers and laptops before releasing it to the main server, and back-end PHP is known as a general-purpose scripting language that can be used to develop dynamic and interactive websites, JSON is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. MySQL is a database management system to adds, access and process data stored in a computer data base, you need a database management system such as MySQL Server.Lastly, there's the Visual Studio code for rapid build and debug cycles.
3.1.2 Hardware
Following the system's implementation, the manager, head officer, along customers is conducted using computers, and laptops.

3.2 System Design
3.2.1 Logical View

3.2.4 Development View
       The development view depicts a system from the standpoint of a programmer and is concerned with software administration. This is often referred to as the implementation view. It describes system components using the Back-end side and the Front-end side of the system. 
 



3.2.4.1 Case Diagram

These are the scenarios that are going to happen to the system is shown below in Figure 3.2.4.1






Figure 3.2.4.1 Case Diagram















3.3 System Development

This stage will be done following the System Design to ensure each plan detail will be completed. For the back-end side of the system, will be used Hapi.js. Then MongoDB for the database and storing of data. For the front-end side, the system will be using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript for the website.
3.4 Testing and Evaluation

During the testing phase, the researcher applies Alpha Testing. Alpha testing is a type of acceptance testing used to uncover potential faults or bugs before releasing the final product to the end-users. Alpha testing is made out by testers who are internal organization employees. The fundamental purpose is to identify and test the tasks that a typical user could accomplish. To put it as simply as possible, this type of testing is named alpha only because it is performed early on, near the end of software development, and before beta testing. The primary goal of alpha testing is to replicate real users through a black box and white box methodologies.
